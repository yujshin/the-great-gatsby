    THE GREAT GATSBY</a></h2>
  <h2>CHAPTER 01. A NEW LIFE IN THE EAST</h2>
  <p>Many years ago, my father gave me <strong>some <u>advice</u></strong>,
  which I have always remembered. " When you are tempted to judge someone,
  try to remember that many people have not had the some opportunities as yourself."</p>
  <img src="whisper.jpg" width="100%">
  <p style='margin-top:40px;'>He didn't elaborate any further. He didn't have to. I knew exactly what he meant.
  We had an unspoken understanding of one another. Because of his advice, I have always
  erred on the side of caution. This, in turn, caused me to become known
  as a non-judgemental sort of character who was then subjected to the mundane conversations
  of a good number of individuals.I was also unfairly labeled a politician,
  and whenever I felt that another was going to confine in me,
  I would often pretend to be asleep or just focus my attentions eleswhere.
